Deploying Project on AWS

step 1: Setting up Project with Github

        We need to first run the project in our local systems.So,let's create the particular environment for it.
        -Open the specific folder where you want to store your project
        -Clone the project from the GithHub : git clone (project url from GitHub)
        -Make a specific environment to run the project so that it cannot affect your local system : virtualenv -p python3.7 env(name of environment)
        -Activate the environment : sournce env/bin/activate
        
step 2: Follow the instructions from README.md file
    
step 3: Run the App in the AWS EC2 instance
        -Create the EC2 instance
        -login to EC2 instance through your terminal with SSH Client.
        -make a directory called project, open project folder
        -git clone project link
        -cd django-todo 
        -Sudo apt install python2-pip
